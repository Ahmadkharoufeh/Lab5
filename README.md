# Lab5 
### summary
After doing this lab I really enjoyed this lab compared to the other one I had to do. I really enjoyed learning how to use the lucidchart website and learned who to use it. Just after doing this lab and using that website, I really can't wait to see what elses i learn with the next few labs.

### Lucidchart
After signing up and becoming the first assassinated with this website I do have to say I enjoyed it. The drications kinda had me think about what i have to do but I think beside trying to understand what i had to do i felt like that website was easy to use and string forward.

### Introduction to Networking
Data Transmission
Packet:Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
IP Address: Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com 
DNS: Unit of data 
Protocol:Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

Network Hardware 
the reason why a switch is better than hub is because a hub can easily get messed up and also a switch can remember mac addresses 
A rotor is way better than a hub and a switch because it is way smarter than the other so it knows if the data coming is supposed to come.
3 daily acquire authentication could be signing in everyday having a hire up person watch you do any changes.

Network Topologies
I feel that wireless mash is the better one of the two because even if one goes down the data will still transfer data.

Network Design
In this part of the lab I thought of something that might help me out later in my career and that is to have my own dealership and who knows maybe even use this drawing as my logo.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption 
Information Systems Security
ACL which identifies a list of users who have the capability to take specific actions with an information resource such as data files. so in other words i feel like i can relate this to like maybe a computer account like a parent can have everything and then a kids account is when a partant sets limits to what the kid can do. after a while it gets harder to maintain
 RBAC, instead of giving specific users access rights to an information resource, users are assigned to roles and then those roles are assigned the access.  This is basically the same thing as ACL but way more improved since ACL would get harder to Matthew over time.
 
 ciphertext: decodes any codes it gets.
 public key:  gives anyone who wants to send the recipient a message. 
 private key: decrypt the message and then read the plain text.
 
 We need public key cryptography because it helps people that are not authorized to know what  is going on not to see it.
 
 Cryptography 
 after typing it out and turning the wheel it looks like a bunch of random letters typed in the box. In the second part of this I put in the box my name is ahmad. And it looks like he was used the most because the box was taller than any other one and that it was red.
 
 Polyalphabetic cipher: is just something written so on you and that other person knows.
 
 Brute-Force is when people guess your password by using random letters.
 Kerckhoffs's allows messages to be sent out with anything showing any person information.
